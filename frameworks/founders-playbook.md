# The Founder's Playbook: Zero to Legend

## Purpose
This is the ONE document a solo founder reads on Day 0. It answers: What do I do?
In what order? How much does it cost? When do I hire? When do I raise? How do I
not die? Every other agent and framework provides depth — this provides SEQUENCE.

---

## WEEK 0: Before Writing a Single Line of Code

### Vision, Mission & Values

```
VISION (what the world looks like if you succeed — 10-year horizon):
Template: "A world where [target users] can [desired outcome] without [current pain]."
Example: "A world where every small business in India can accept payments as easily as cash."
Rules: Aspirational. Not about your product — about the WORLD your product creates.
       Should make you emotional. If it doesn't, it's not big enough.

MISSION (how you'll make the vision real — 3-year horizon):
Template: "We [action] for [target users] by [method], enabling them to [outcome]."
Example: "We build instant digital payment tools for India's 60M small businesses,
enabling them to grow revenue and serve customers better."
Rules: Specific, actionable, measurable progress toward the vision.

VALUES (how you behave on the journey — these are your hiring/firing criteria):
DON'T: List generic values ("integrity, innovation, teamwork" — meaningless).
DO: List specific behaviors with examples of what they look like in practice.

EXAMPLE VALUES:
- "Users first, revenue second": We will NEVER ship a dark pattern. If user value and
  revenue conflict, users win. Always.
- "Speed over perfection": Ship in days, not months. 80% today beats 100% next quarter.
  BUT: Never ship security bugs. Speed applies to features, not safety.
- "Disagree then commit": Debate hard in the room. Once decided, execute as one team.
  Passive resistance is worse than open disagreement.
- "Default to transparent": Share metrics, share failures, share context. The only secrets
  are personnel issues and pre-announcement legal matters.

WRITE THESE DOWN DAY 0. Revisit annually. Never violate them, even when it's expensive.
```

### Legal Foundation (Day 0 costs: ₹15-50K)

```
INDIA PATH:
□ Incorporate Private Limited Company via MCA portal
  - Cost: ₹8-15K (via CA/CS, includes government fees)
  - Timeline: 7-15 days
  - Documents: PAN, Aadhaar, address proof, passport-size photo of directors
  - Minimum 2 directors, 2 shareholders (can be same people)
  - Authorized capital: ₹10L initially (sufficient for seed stage)
□ Register for GST (if turnover expected >₹40L goods / ₹20L services)
□ Open current (business) bank account (ICICI Startup, HDFC, Razorpay X)
□ Register on Startup India (DPIIT recognition — free, gives tax benefits)
□ File for trademark of your brand name (₹4,500 government fee)

US PATH:
□ Incorporate C-Corp in Delaware via Stripe Atlas / Clerky / FirstBase
  - Cost: $500-2,000 (including registered agent for 1 year)
  - Timeline: 1-3 days
□ Get EIN from IRS (free, online)
□ Open business bank account (Mercury, Brex, SVB)
□ File 83(b) election within 30 days of receiving founder shares (CRITICAL — saves massive taxes later)

WEBSITE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS (before going live):
□ Privacy Policy — MANDATORY everywhere. What data you collect, why, how you protect it.
  Use a template from iubenda, Termly, or have a lawyer draft (₹10-30K)
□ Terms of Service — MANDATORY. Liability limits, acceptable use, dispute resolution.
□ Cookie Policy + Consent Banner — MANDATORY for EU/UK users, best practice globally.
  Use Cookiebot, OneTrust, or CookieYes
□ Refund/Cancellation Policy — MANDATORY for e-commerce (Consumer Protection Act India)
□ Impressum — MANDATORY for Germany/Austria (company details on website)

WEBSITE FOOTER (what MUST be there legally):
□ © [Year] [Company Name]. All rights reserved.

□ Company registration: CIN number (India) or incorporation state (US)
□ GST number (India, if registered)

□ "Made in India" / country of origin (if applicable)
□ Accessibility statement (increasingly required — EU, US Section 508)
```

## WEEK 1-2: Validate Before You Build

```
COST: ₹0-5K (mostly your time)

□ Talk to 30 potential users (minimum). Not friends — strangers who have the problem.
  Ask: "Tell me about the last time you experienced [problem]."
  DON'T ask: "Would you use an app that does X?" (everyone says yes, nobody means it)

□ Map the competitive landscape (Agent 02 Discovery)
  - Use every competitor's product personally
  - Read their 1-star App Store reviews (= their failures = your opportunity)

□ Write your ONE-SENTENCE hypothesis:
  "I believe [users] will [behavior] if I provide [solution], and I'll know it's true
  when I see [metric] reach [threshold] within [timeframe]."

□ Decision gate: GO / PIVOT / KILL
  - If 20+ of 30 people describe the problem passionately → GO
  - If 10-20 describe it mildly → PIVOT (maybe different angle on same problem)
  - If <10 care → KILL this idea, find a better problem
```

## WEEK 3-4: Design the MVP (NOT the Full Product)

```
COST: ₹0-30K (design tools, maybe a freelance designer)

□ Define the core value loop (Agent 03 Strategy + MVP Framework):
  [User action] → [System delivers value] → [User gets outcome]
  Example: Browse restaurants → Order food → Food arrives

□ Apply the CUT TEST to every feature:
  "Can a user complete the core loop WITHOUT this?" YES → Cut it.
  Typical MVP: 3-5 screens. Signup + core flow + done.

□ Design the screens (Agent 05 + anti-slop-design skill)
  - Use Figma (free for 3 projects)
  - Design: Default + Loading + Empty + Error states for each screen
  - Don't obsess over pixel-perfection — focus on flow clarity

□ Write the PRD for MVP features ONLY (Agent 04 + PRD Framework)
```

## WEEK 5-10: Build the MVP

```
COST: ₹0-5L (depending on team vs. solo, hosting, tools)

SOLO FOUNDER (no co-founder, building yourself):
- Tech stack: Whatever you know best. Ship speed > architecture perfection.
- Hosting: Vercel/Railway/Render free tier → AWS/GCP when you need scale
- Database: Supabase (free tier) or PlanetScale or Railway Postgres
- Payments: Razorpay (India) or Stripe (global) — sandbox first
- Analytics: PostHog (free, self-hosted) or Mixpanel free tier
- Monitoring: Sentry free tier
- Total monthly cost: ₹0-5K on free tiers

WITH CO-FOUNDER / SMALL TEAM (2-3 people):
- Same stack, faster velocity
- ESOP pool: Set up 10-15% before any external investment
- Founder agreement: Vesting, IP assignment, roles, what happens if someone leaves

OUTSOURCING (if non-technical founder):
- Agency: ₹3-15L for MVP (be VERY specific with requirements)
- Freelancer: ₹1-5L for MVP (higher risk, needs strong project management)
- No-code: ₹0-1L (Bubble, FlutterFlow — fine for validation, plan to rebuild)
- WARNING: Own your code. Ensure contract gives you full IP ownership.

TIMELINE: 6-8 weeks maximum. If it's taking longer, you're building too much.
```

## WEEK 11-14: Launch & Learn

```
COST: ₹5-20K (marketing, tools)

□ Soft launch to 50-200 hand-picked users
  - Friends of friends, communities, early waitlist signups
  - Personal outreach: "I built this to solve [problem]. Would you try it and tell me honestly?"

□ Track these metrics from Day 1 (Agent 16):
  - Signup → First value action (activation rate) — target: >30%
  - D1 / D7 retention — are they coming back?
  - Core action completion rate — does the thing actually work?
  - NPS: "How likely to recommend?" — target: >30

□ Talk to EVERY early user. Not surveys — actual conversations.
  "What almost made you stop? What confused you? What's missing?"

□ Fix the top 3 things that prevent activation or retention. Nothing else matters yet.
