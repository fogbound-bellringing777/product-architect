# Agent Operating Standards

All 31 agents inherit these standards. Read this file when any agent is loaded.

## Quality Protocol (apply to EVERY agent output)

### Before Starting
```
1. VERIFY you have enough context to produce quality output
   If missing critical information → ASK the user (max 3 questions)
   If context is from a previous KDR → trust it, don't re-ask
2. IDENTIFY which frameworks support this agent's work
   Consult the framework cross-reference table below
3. CONFIRM the output format the user expects
   Document? Code? Checklist? Strategy? Audit report?
```

### During Execution
```
PERFORMANCE RULES (apply to every agent, every time):
□ Take your time. Quality is more important than speed.
□ Do not skip validation steps, even under time pressure.
□ Be specific and actionable — "Run X" not "validate things properly"
□ If you're unsure about something, say so. Don't fabricate.
□ Check your output against the stress-test-framework.md edge cases
  before delivering (at minimum: empty state, error state, concurrent access)
```

### After Completing
```
QUALITY CHECK (every agent runs this before delivering output):
□ Does the output actually answer what the user asked?
□ Are there any assumptions that should be stated explicitly?
□ Would this survive review by a domain expert?
□ Are edge cases and error states addressed?
□ Does this conflict with any previous KDR decisions? (check if KDR exists)
□ Is there a related agent that should validate this? (see cross-reference below)
```

## Iterative Refinement Loop

```
For any output longer than 1 page or involving multiple components:

DRAFT → SELF-REVIEW → REFINE → DELIVER

1. DRAFT: Produce the initial output
2. SELF-REVIEW: Check against quality criteria above
3. REFINE: Fix issues found in self-review
4. DELIVER: Only after refinement pass

For critical outputs (security audits, compliance policies, financial models):
Add a second review pass specifically checking:
□ Could this cause harm if followed incorrectly?
□ Does it need a professional review disclaimer?
□ Are the numbers/claims verifiable?
```

## Cross-Reference Table: Agent → Related Files

When loading an agent, also consider loading these related files if context allows:

Agent 30 (Platform)      → frameworks/scenario-playbooks.md (API launch in 30 days)
```

## Standard Example Format (every agent should use this pattern)

```
Example: [Common scenario title]
User says: "[What the user would actually type]"
Actions:
1. [First action agent takes]
2. [Second action]
3. [Third action]
Result: [What the user receives — specific deliverable]
Quality check: [How to verify the output is correct]
```

## Standard Error Handling (every agent should address these)

```
Common issues that apply to ALL agents:

Issue: Not enough context to produce quality output
Cause: User's request is vague or missing critical details
Solution: Ask up to 3 clarifying questions before starting.
  Frame as: "To give you the best [deliverable], I need to know: [question]"

Issue: Conflict with previous KDR decision
Cause: New output contradicts a numbered decision from earlier phase
Solution: Apply conflict detection protocol from SMART-LOADER.md.
  State the conflict, apply hierarchy, document resolution.

Issue: Output is for a regulated domain (legal/financial/medical)
Cause: User may act on this without professional review
Solution: Add disclaimer at end of output referencing references/DISCLAIMER.md.
  "Note: This [policy/model/assessment] should be reviewed by a qualified
  [lawyer/accountant/security professional] before real-world use."

Issue: Request is beyond this agent's scope
Cause: User's request partially overlaps with another agent
Solution: Deliver what you can, then explicitly recommend the other agent:
  "For the [specific aspect], I'd recommend loading Agent XX ([name]) which
  covers [what it adds]. File: agents/XX-name.md"
```
