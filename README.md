# Product Architect

**The most comprehensive open-source product development system ever built.**

31 specialized AI agents. 20 strategic frameworks. 5 country compliance deep-dives. 12,000+ lines of actionable content. An interactive navigator. A complete founder's playbook. Everything a solo founder needs to build a world-class company from Day 0 to IPO — and everything a product team needs to operate at Fortune 500 caliber.

---

## What Is This?

Product Architect is a multi-agent skill system for [Claude](https://claude.ai) that transforms any product idea into a complete, executable blueprint. It covers **every department, function, process, and policy** that exists in a world-class company.

Think of it as having the entire C-suite — CPO, CTO, CFO, COO, CMO, CISO, GC, CHRO, and 22 more department heads — available as specialized agents that work together, review each other's output, and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

### Who Is This For?

- **Solo founders** — A complete roadmap from Day 0 with costs, timelines, and what to do at each stage
- **Product managers** — Production-grade PRDs, user flows, edge case coverage, A/B testing frameworks
- **Engineering leads** — Architecture docs, test strategies, DevOps plans, security audits
- **Startup teams** — Financial models, hiring plans, compliance checklists, governance structures
- **Anyone building a product** — The reference library you wish existed when you started

## Quick Start

### With Claude (recommended)

Upload the `product-architect/` folder to your Claude project's knowledge or skills directory. Then:

```
"I want to build [your product idea]"     → Full system activates in phases
"Write a PRD for [feature]"               → PRD agent + framework loads
"How much should I raise?"                → Finance agent + founder's playbook
"Security audit for my payment system"    → Security + compliance agents
"I need a checklist for vendor selection"  → Universal checklist generator
```

### As Standalone Reference

Every file is self-contained. Browse `agents/` and `frameworks/` for any topic:

## Key Features

**Smart Loading** — The system is 12,000+ lines but never loads everything at once. `SMART-LOADER.md` routes each request to only the relevant agents, keeping Claude fast and context-efficient.

**Memory That Survives** — The KDR (Key Decision Record) system outputs structured state summaries after every phase. These survive chat compaction and can be pasted into new conversations to resume exactly where you left off. Works on free tier.

**Global by Default** — Dedicated compliance deep-dives for India, US, EU, UK, and 6 Southeast Asian countries. Payment methods, tax rules, employment law, and industry regulations per market.

**Founder's Playbook** — A week-by-week guide from Day 0 with exact costs at each stage, fundraising amounts by round, pitch deck structure, website legal requirements, and scaling milestones.

**20+ SOPs with Process Maps** — Step-by-step processes for every department with automation opportunities flagged and recommended tools.

**14 Complete Policies** — Code of conduct, anti-harassment (POSH), whistleblower, information security, data protection, anti-bribery, conflict of interest, insider trading, and more. Not templates — actual policies ready to customize.

**Read [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md) before using this in production.**

This repository is an educational and operational reference framework created through
human-AI collaboration. It is **not a substitute for professional legal, financial,
security, or HR advice.** All policies, compliance frameworks, and legal templates
must be reviewed by qualified professionals before adoption. The 14 policy drafts,
country compliance guides, salary bands, and financial models are starting frameworks —

*Built through iterative collaboration between a human product thinker and Claude (Anthropic). Each agent was refined across multiple sessions until every department, function, and process was covered with consulting-grade depth.*
