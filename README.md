## Key Architecture

**Smart Loading** — `SMART-LOADER.md` routes each request to only the relevant agents. Scores agents 0-10 on relevance, handles multi-intent requests, supports dynamic mid-conversation loading. Never loads everything at once. Free tier: 3 agents/turn. Pro: 5 agents/turn.

**Cross-Agent Governance** — 4-level authority hierarchy prevents contradictions: Compliance (override) → Security (override) → Finance (veto) → Chief Reviewer (veto). 5-step conflict protocol: stop, state, apply hierarchy, document, flag.

**KDR Memory** — Key Decision Records with sequential numbering, conflict detection (scan-before-record), and SUPERSEDED mechanism. Survives chat compaction. Works on free tier. Paste MASTER KDR into new conversations to resume.

**Agent Standards** — Shared quality protocol inherited by all agents: before/during/after checklists, iterative refinement loops, performance rules, cross-reference table mapping every agent to related frameworks.
