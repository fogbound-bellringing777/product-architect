# SMART-LOADER v2: Context Router + Memory Engine

## READ THIS FILE FIRST. ALWAYS. BEFORE ANY OTHER FILE.

This file is the brain of the Product Architect system. It decides what to load,
manages context efficiently, and ensures nothing is ever lost — even across chat
compaction, session limits, or new conversations.

---

## STEP 1: Classify the Request

Read the user's message. Match to ONE of these patterns:

```
PATTERN A — SINGLE TOPIC: "Write a PRD / Design an app / Financial model / etc."
→ Load: 1-2 agents + 1 framework. Done in 1 turn.

PATTERN B — MULTI-TOPIC: "Product roadmap / Marketing strategy / Launch plan"
→ Load: 3-4 agents + 1-2 frameworks. Done in 1-2 turns.

PATTERN C — FULL PRODUCT: "Build me a complete product / Full product from scratch"
→ Phased execution across 5-6 turns. See Phase Plan below.

PATTERN D — CONTINUE PREVIOUS: User references past work or pastes a KDR/MKDR.
→ Read the KDR. Resume from where they left off. Don't reload completed phases.

PATTERN E — CHECKLIST/QUICK ANSWER: "Checklist for X / How much to raise / etc."
→ Load: 1 framework only. Quick response. No multi-phase needed.
```

## STEP 2: Agent Routing Table

```
REQUEST CONTAINS          → LOAD THESE AGENTS           → LOAD THESE FRAMEWORKS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
"PRD" / "requirements"    → 04                          → prd-framework
"design" / "UI" / "app"   → 05                          → (anti-slop-design skill)
"roadmap" / "strategy"    → 02 + 03                     → roadmap + consulting
"MVP" / "build"           → 03 + 04                     → mvp-framework
"financial" / "pricing"   → 18                          → compensation-bands
"security" / "audit"      → 09 + 11                     → global-compliance
"marketing" / "growth"    → 15 + 14                     → ab-testing
"hiring" / "team"         → 22                          → compensation-bands
"legal" / "compliance"    → 10 + 11                     → global-compliance

"operations" / "SOP"      → 19 + 20                     → sop-process-maps
"IPO" / "board"           → 26 + 18                     → corporate-scaling
"trust" / "moderation"    → 12                          → —
"fraud"                   → 13                          → —
"AI" / "ML" / "data"      → 29                          → —
"ESG" / "sustainability"  → 27                          → —
"checklist for"           → (none)                      → universal-checklists
"how to start" / "day 0"  → (none)                      → founders-playbook
"review" / "audit all"    → 00 + 01                     → coverage-audit
"complete product"        → PHASE PLAN (see below)      →
```

## STEP 3: Context Budget Rules

```
HARD RULES:
□ NEVER load more than 5 agent files in a single turn
□ NEVER load SKILL.md + SMART-LOADER.md + 5 agents (too much context waste)
□ SMART-LOADER is the ONLY file always in context
□ For Pattern C (full product): Execute in phases, output KDR between each
□ Reserve 40% of context for conversation history + user's files/input
□ If user is on free tier: Be MORE aggressive about phasing (smaller chunks per turn)

LOADING PRIORITY:
1. SMART-LOADER.md (always — you're reading it now)
2. The PRIMARY agent for the task (the one that produces the main deliverable)
3. The relevant framework (template/structure for the deliverable)
4. SECONDARY agents (validation, review, suggestions)
5. Agent 01 (Proactive Advisor) — if context budget allows
```

## STEP 4: Full Product Phase Plan

For "build me a complete product" requests:

```
PHASE A — FOUNDATION (Turn 1):
  Load: Agent 02 (Discovery) + Agent 03 (Strategy) + consulting-frameworks
  Output: Discovery Brief + Product Strategy
  → Output KDR-A at end of turn

PHASE B — SPECIFICATION (Turn 2):
  Load: Agent 04 (PRD) + Agent 05 (Design) + prd-framework + user-flows
  Input: KDR-A (provides context from Phase A)
  Output: PRD + Design direction + Key user flows
  → Output KDR-B at end of turn

PHASE C — ENGINEERING & TESTING (Turn 3):
  Load: Agent 06 (Engineering) + Agent 07 (Testing) + Agent 08 (DevOps)
  Input: KDR-A + KDR-B
  Output: Architecture + Test strategy + DevOps plan
  → Output KDR-C at end of turn

PHASE D — BUSINESS & OPERATIONS (Turn 4):
  Load: Agent 18 (Finance) + Agent 19 (Ops) + Agent 15 (Marketing)
  Input: KDR-A + KDR-B + KDR-C
  Output: Financial model + Ops plan + GTM strategy
  → Output KDR-D at end of turn

PHASE E — GOVERNANCE & COMPLIANCE (Turn 5):
  Load: Agent 11 (Compliance) + Agent 22 (People) + Agent 26 (Governance)
  Input: All previous KDRs
  Output: Policy framework + Hiring plan + Governance structure
  → Output KDR-E at end of turn

PHASE F — FINAL AUDIT (Turn 6):
  Load: Agent 00 (Chief Reviewer) + Agent 01 (Advisor)
  Input: All KDRs
  Output: Comprehensive audit report + Proactive suggestions
  → Output MASTER KDR (complete state of the product)

Between phases, ASK: "Phase [X] complete. Ready for Phase [X+1]?"
This gives the user control and lets them ask questions or adjust before continuing.
```

## MEMORY & COMPACTION ENGINE

### The Problem
Claude's chat history gets compacted in long conversations, especially on free tier.
Earlier details disappear. Without a system, the user has to repeat everything.

### The Solution: Key Decision Records (KDR)

**After EVERY phase or major deliverable, output a KDR block.**
KDRs are structured summaries that capture the COMPLETE state in minimum tokens.
They survive compaction because they're recent. They can be pasted into new chats.

### KDR Format (Phase-Level)

TO CONTINUE: Paste this MASTER KDR into a new conversation with Claude and say
"Continue my product work from this KDR." Claude will pick up exactly where you left off.
```

### Memory Rules

```
RULE 1: Output a KDR after EVERY phase — non-negotiable.
RULE 2: KDR must capture ALL decisions, not just major ones.
        "We chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB" is a decision. Record it.
RULE 3: KDR must capture ALL open items and questions.
        "User hasn't decided on pricing yet" is an open item. Record it.
RULE 4: When a user pastes a KDR, TRUST IT as ground truth.
        Don't re-ask questions that are already answered in the KDR.
RULE 5: If context seems to be missing (compaction happened):
        Ask: "I may have lost some earlier context. Could you paste
        the latest KDR or MASTER KDR? That will restore everything."
RULE 6: Output MASTER KDR at end of every session, not just full-product sessions.
        Even a single-topic session (just a PRD) should end with a mini-KDR.
RULE 7: Number all decisions sequentially across phases.
        This creates an audit trail: "As decided in #14, we're using Razorpay..."
```

### Conflict Detection Protocol (THE CRITICAL MECHANISM)

```
BEFORE RECORDING ANY NEW DECISION, CLAUDE MUST:

1. SCAN all previous decisions in the current KDR chain for contradictions.
2. If a new decision CONFLICTS with a previous numbered decision:

   ⚠️ CONFLICT DETECTED:
   Decision #[new]: [Agent X] recommends [new thing]
   Decision #[old]: [Agent Y] previously decided [old thing]
   These are INCOMPATIBLE because: [specific reason]

   RESOLUTION (apply hierarchy from SKILL.md):
   → If Compliance/Security/Finance override applies → auto-resolve, document why
   → If no clear hierarchy → STOP and ask user:
     "Decisions #[old] and #[new] conflict. Which do you want to keep?"

3. Record the resolution as a new decision:
   Decision #[N]: CONFLICT RESOLVED — [old decision] updated to [new decision]
   because [reason]. Previous Decision #[old] is SUPERSEDED.

EXAMPLES:
Decision #7 (Strategy): "Target SMBs with ₹499/month pricing"
Decision #19 (Finance): "Need ₹999/month minimum for positive unit economics"
→ ⚠️ CONFLICT: #7 and #19 — pricing doesn't cover costs
→ Resolution: Ask user. Options: raise price, reduce costs, or accept negative margins for growth.
→ Decision #20: CONFLICT RESOLVED — Pricing set to ₹699/month with ₹999 target
   by Month 6. Decision #7 SUPERSEDED.

Decision #12 (Engineering): "Store user location history for recommendations"
Decision #23 (Compliance): "DPDP Act requires purpose limitation — location
   for recommendations requires explicit consent"
→ ⚠️ CONFLICT: #12 and #23 — data collection without consent flow
→ Resolution: Compliance overrides (hierarchy Rule 1). Auto-resolved.
→ Decision #24: CONFLICT RESOLVED — Add consent prompt before location collection.
   Decision #12 UPDATED to include consent requirement.

THIS IS THE MECHANISM THAT PREVENTS 31 AGENTS FROM CONTRADICTING EACH OTHER.
Without it, each agent operates in isolation. With it, every decision is checked
against every previous decision, and conflicts are surfaced before they become bugs.
```

### Handling Context Loss Gracefully

```
SCENARIO: Chat was compacted. User says "continue where we left off."
→ Check conversation history for any KDR blocks
→ If found: Use the most recent KDR as ground truth, continue from there
→ If not found: Ask user "Could you paste the MASTER KDR from our last session?"
→ If user doesn't have it: Ask the key questions to reconstruct context
  (product, market, stage, what's been done, what's next)
→ NEVER pretend you remember something you don't. Be honest about context loss.

SCENARIO: User starts new conversation referencing previous work.
→ If Claude's memory has context: Use it as starting point
→ If not: Ask for KDR or ask reconstruction questions
→ NEVER make up previous decisions. Always verify with the user.

SCENARIO: Session is about to hit token limit.
→ Output MASTER KDR immediately, even mid-phase
→ Tell user: "We're approaching the session limit. I've saved our complete
  state in the MASTER KDR above. Start a new conversation, paste it in,
  and we'll continue seamlessly."
```
